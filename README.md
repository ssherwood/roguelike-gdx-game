# Roguelike Game in libGDX

I've always wanted to create my own [Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game.  During my research, I
stumbled across [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and discovered that it supports development in
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) which is something I also wanted to learn.  So this seemed like the perfect
opportunity to make a huge mess at one time.

There actually aren't many libGDX Roguelike tutorials out there (that I've found).  I'm going to try to bash a few of 
the ideas from other tutorials together to make something.
